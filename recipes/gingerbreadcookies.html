        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter and brown sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add molasses, egg, and vanilla; mix well. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until well mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press dough into a thick, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into gingerbread men shapes with a 5-inch cookie cutter. Place gingerbread men 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are set and just begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Decorate cooled cookies as desired. Store cookies in airtight container up to 5 days.
